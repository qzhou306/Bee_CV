All-in-one implementation

Off-line solution
1. use camera only to capture video
2. Process and test video/images offline

Real-time solution #1
1. YOLO fastest will be better in speed than YOLOv3 and in accuracy than YOLO tiny for the 2 step object detection
2. Rasberry Pi : https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/01/27/yolo-and-tiny-yolo-object-detection-on-the-raspberry-pi-and-movidius-ncs/
3. Convert video to image: save all images vs. save it in a 3D array and get overwritten every frame? 
4. Frame by frame on the big image
5. Run YOLO big image model to generate json files for bounding boxes and probability 
6. Crop bounding boxes from step 2 and create chip images (naming convention - bee_imagefilename_number)
7. Run "Multiple Images at Once":  !./darknet detector test $objPath $configPath $weightsPath -ext_output -dont_show -out result.json < $val_img_list > result.txt
